# Interim Submission Report for Week 6 Challenge

## Overview
As part of the Bati Bank project, my role is to create a Credit Scoring Model to help the bank enable a buy-now-pay-later service in partnership with a successful eCommerce company. This service will allow customers to purchase products on credit based on their eligibility, determined by the model. The objective is to assess the creditworthiness of potential customers and assign a credit score that reflects their risk of default.

The project entails various stages, including defining proxy variables for categorizing users into risk groups, selecting predictive features, and developing models to estimate risk probabilities, credit scores, and optimal loan amounts.

## Business Concept
Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, aims to collaborate with an eCommerce platform to offer a buy-now-pay-later option. To support this initiative, I have been tasked with creating a Credit Scoring Model. Credit scoring models evaluate the likelihood of default based on past borrowing data, enabling financial institutions to estimate risk and make lending decisions.

The model is required to:
1. Define a proxy variable for high-risk (bad) or low-risk (good) users.
2. Select observable features that correlate strongly with the default risk.
3. Develop a risk probability model to assess new customers.
4. Assign credit scores based on risk probabilities.
5. Predict the optimal loan amount and duration for borrowers.

The model's development must comply with financial standards such as the Basel II Capital Accord, which defines the parameters for measuring and managing credit risk.

## Task 1: Understanding Credit Risk
For Task 1, I focused on understanding the credit risk landscape, particularly as it relates to the financial sector and lending practices. Credit risk refers to the possibility that a borrower will fail to meet obligations, such as repaying a loan, resulting in losses for the lender. Building an accurate model involves understanding key concepts, risk measurement techniques, and predictive modeling methods.

Key components I reviewed include:
- Credit scoring techniques: Methods that quantify a borrower's creditworthiness based on past behavior, credit history, and other financial indicators.
- Basel II Capital Accord: This framework outlines standards for credit risk assessment and capital requirements for banks.
- Proxy variable definition: One of the early steps involves defining a suitable default proxy variable based on historical transaction data.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of Task 2, I initiated the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which involves:
1. Understanding the data fields.
2. Identifying relevant features.
3. Dealing with missing data.
4. Visualizing the data.

## Next Steps
- Complete EDA and feature engineering.
- Develop initial Machine Learning models for credit risk.
- Tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing models.

## Conclusion
This interim report covers the progress made so far on the Credit Scoring Model project. With Task 1 fully understood, I am now progressing through the data analysis phase, which will form the foundation for the model-building stage.
